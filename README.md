## Introduction

Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a field of study that involves the detection of emotions from speech signals. This repository provides tools and models for analyzing speech signals and predicting the underlying emotional state.

## Features

- **Preprocessing**: Signal processing techniques for extracting features from speech signals.
- **Model Development**: Machine learning and deep learning models for emotion recognition.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluation metrics and tools for assessing model performance.
- **Visualization**: Visualization techniques for analyzing emotion patterns in speech data.

## Dataset

The project uses the Revdas-tees dataset, which contains audio files with diffrent emotions. The dataset is available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/preethikurra/ravdess-tess.

## Installation

To set up the environment for Speech Emotion Recognition, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/MySpace03/Speech-Emotion-Recognition.git

2. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

To use the Speech Emotion Recognition tools and models, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your speech dataset or use the provided dataset.
2. Preprocess the speech signals to extract features.
3. Train the emotion recognition model using the provided scripts or develop your own.
4. Evaluate the model's performance using evaluation metrics.
5. Visualize the emotion patterns in the speech data using the visualization tools.
